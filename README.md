# Chamaeleo

### Chamaeleo is a tool used to quickly pull down binaries from remote servers via VyperVPN, using the fastest configuration available. The filenames will be the MD5 hash of the file itself and then the file will be gzipped. *Please note, a VyperVPN account is necessary*

### Currently working on multi-threaded version.

#### Please Note: You may want to change the location of the download and compressed files. They are currently set as /home.
